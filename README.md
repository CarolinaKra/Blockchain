# Blockchain Development
I developed a blockchain for a cryptocurrency which includes the units of transactions, blocks and the blockchain status

## Code and Resources
* **Python version:** 3.7
* **Packages:** cryptography, math, time, random, copy
* **Python files given by Prof. Zimmer to work in distribuited blockchain:** connections, mempool, main, miner, node, node, persistance 

## Project Overview
* Development of a cryptocurrency
* Development of the transaction unit, using cryptography for the transaction signature and the transaction verification
* Development of the block unit, and the function for mining a block using proof-of-work as the consensus mechanism
* Development of the blockchain itself with the possibility of reorg in the case of a fork, keeping the chain with the highest difficulty
* The development of a blockchain keeps track of the user status, which includes a nonce and its balance.
* Unification of the developed code with other given programmes to be able to mine blocks in a distributed blockchain.
* Further research and essay writing on different areas within the cryptocurrency world
